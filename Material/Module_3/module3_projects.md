## **1. Bias-Variance Tradeoff: Polynomial Regression on a Real Dataset**  
### **Objective:**  
Demonstrate bias-variance tradeoff by fitting polynomial regression models of different degrees and analyzing their performance.

### **Steps:**  
1. **Load Data:** Choose a dataset with a clear relationship between input and output variables (e.g., Boston Housing Dataset).  
2. **Split Data:** Divide it into training and test sets using `train_test_split()`.  
3. **Fit Different Polynomial Models:** Train polynomial regression models with degrees 1, 3, and 10.  
4. **Evaluate Performance:** Use mean squared error (MSE) to check underfitting (high bias) and overfitting (high variance).  
5. **Plot Results:** Visualize how each model fits the data and highlight the tradeoff.  

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas

## **2. Cross-Validation on a Classification Task**  
### **Objective:**  
Implement k-fold cross-validation to compare multiple classification models on the same dataset.

### **Steps:**  
1. **Choose Dataset:** Use a dataset like the UCI Breast Cancer dataset.  
2. **Preprocess Data:** Handle missing values and normalize features.  
3. **Apply Models:** Train models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.  
4. **Perform k-Fold Cross-Validation:** Use `cross_val_score()` from scikit-learn to evaluate models.  
5. **Analyze Results:** Compare average accuracy across different models to determine the best one.  

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

## **3. Regularization Effect on Linear Regression**  
### **Objective:**  
Show how L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization impact model complexity and feature selection.

### **Steps:**  
1. **Load Data:** Use a dataset with multiple features, such as the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn.  
2. **Train Linear Regression:** Fit a standard linear regression model and note the coefficients.  
3. **Apply L1 and L2 Regularization:** Train Lasso and Ridge regression models.  
4. **Compare Coefficients:** Observe how L1 reduces some coefficients to zero (feature selection) and how L2 reduces their magnitude.  
5. **Evaluate Performance:** Compare test accuracy of all models.  

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib

## **4. Generative vs Discriminative Model for Spam Classification**  
### **Objective:**  
Compare a generative model (Naïve Bayes) and a discriminative model (Logistic Regression) for spam email classification.

### **Steps:**  
1. **Get Dataset:** Use the SpamAssassin dataset or the SMS Spam Collection dataset.  
2. **Text Preprocessing:** Convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.  
3. **Train Naïve Bayes Model:** Use scikit-learn’s `MultinomialNB()` to build a generative model.  
4. **Train Logistic Regression Model:** Use `LogisticRegression()` for a discriminative approach.  
5. **Compare Performance:** Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, nltk (for text processing)

## **5. KL Divergence for Comparing Probability Distributions**  
### **Objective:**  
Calculate KL divergence between two probability distributions to measure their difference.

### **Steps:**  
1. **Generate Two Distributions:** Create two probability distributions (e.g., Gaussian distributions with different means).  
2. **Compute KL Divergence:** Use `scipy.stats.entropy()` to measure the divergence between them.  
3. **Visualize Distributions:** Plot both distributions using matplotlib.  
4. **Interpret Results:** Show how a small KL divergence indicates similar distributions, while a high KL divergence indicates major differences.  

**Tools & Libraries:** Python, scipy, numpy, matplotlib
