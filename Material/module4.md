# **Neural Networks in Machine Learning**  

## **1. Introduction to Neural Networks**  
Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain, consisting of layers of neurons that process input data and make predictions. They are widely used in image recognition, natural language processing, and financial modeling.

### **Key Components of a Neural Network:**  
- **Input Layer:** Accepts raw data.  
- **Hidden Layers:** Perform computations using weights and activation functions.  
- **Output Layer:** Produces the final prediction.

## **2. The Perceptron**  
The perceptron is the simplest form of a neural network and is used for binary classification. It consists of a **single-layer neural network** with:  
- **Inputs \( x_1, x_2, ... x_n \)**  
- **Weights \( w_1, w_2, ... w_n \)**  
- **Activation Function (Step Function)**  

### **Mathematical Representation:**  
\[
y = f\left( \sum w_i x_i + b \right)
\]
where:
- \( w_i \) are the weights,
- \( x_i \) are the inputs, and
- \( b \) is the bias.

### **Example: OR Gate Implementation**  
- Input: \( (0,0), (0,1), (1,0), (1,1) \)  
- Output: \( 0, 1, 1, 1 \)  
- Train the perceptron to learn the OR function.

## **3. Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN)**  
Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNNs) are the foundation of deep learning. Data flows **only in one direction**, from input to output, without loops.

### **Steps in a Feed-Forward Network:**
1. **Input Layer:** Accepts data (e.g., stock prices, images).  
2. **Hidden Layers:** Process input using weights and activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid).  
3. **Output Layer:** Produces the final result (classification or regression).  

### **Example:**  
A neural network that predicts house prices using features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.

## **4. Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**  
Backpropagation is an optimization algorithm that updates neural network weights to minimize errors.  

### **Steps in Backpropagation:**
1. **Forward Pass:** Compute output using current weights.  
2. **Calculate Loss:** Compare predicted and actual values.  
3. **Backward Pass:** Compute gradients using chain rule (partial derivatives).  
4. **Update Weights:** Use gradient descent to optimize weights.  

### **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  
Instead of computing the gradient for the entire dataset, SGD updates weights after processing each mini-batch, making it faster for large datasets.

## **5. Regularization and Dropout**  
Regularization prevents **overfitting** by penalizing large weight values.

### **Types of Regularization:**
- **L1 Regularization (Lasso):** Shrinks less important weights to zero.  
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge):** Reduces the magnitude of all weights.  
- **Dropout:** Randomly removes neurons during training to improve generalization.  

### **Example:**  
- Train a neural network on the MNIST dataset with and without dropout.  
- Observe how dropout improves test accuracy by reducing overfitting.

## **6. Application to Investment Management**  
Neural networks are widely used in **investment management** for tasks such as:  

1. **Stock Price Prediction:**  
   - Use historical price data to forecast future prices.  
2. **Portfolio Optimization:**  
   - Train a neural network to optimize asset allocation based on risk-return tradeoffs.  
3. **Fraud Detection in Finance:**  
   - Classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate using deep learning.
