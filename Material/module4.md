# **Neural Networks in Machine Learning**  

## **1. Introduction to Neural Networks**  
Neural networks are powerful computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. They consist of interconnected layers of artificial neurons that process input data and generate predictions. Neural networks are widely used in various fields, including image recognition, natural language processing, medical diagnosis, and financial modeling.  

### **Key Components of a Neural Network:**  
1. **Input Layer:**  
   - The input layer receives raw data, such as images, text, or numerical values.  
   - Each neuron in this layer corresponds to a feature in the dataset.  

2. **Hidden Layers:**  
   - These layers perform complex computations using **weights** and **activation functions**.  
   - The number of hidden layers and neurons determines the networkâ€™s ability to learn patterns in data.  

3. **Output Layer:**  
   - The final layer that provides predictions based on the learned patterns.  
   - In classification tasks, it uses activation functions like **softmax** to output probabilities.

## **2. The Perceptron**  
The perceptron is the simplest type of neural network, consisting of a **single-layer of neurons** used for binary classification problems. It was introduced by **Frank Rosenblatt** in 1958 and serves as the foundation for more complex neural networks.  

### **Structure of a Perceptron:**  
- It consists of multiple **inputs** \( x_1, x_2, ... x_n \) and corresponding **weights** \( w_1, w_2, ... w_n \).  
- The weighted sum of inputs is passed through an **activation function** to determine the output.  

### **Mathematical Representation:**  
\[
y = f\left( \sum w_i x_i + b \right)
\]
where:  
- \( w_i \) are the **weights** assigned to inputs,  
- \( x_i \) are the **input values**,  
- \( b \) is the **bias term**,  
- \( f \) is the **activation function**, which is typically a step function in a perceptron.

### **Example: OR Gate Implementation**  
An OR gate takes two binary inputs and returns a 1 if at least one input is 1.  

| Input \( x_1 \) | Input \( x_2 \) | Output \( y \) |
|---------|---------|---------|
| 0       | 0       | 0       |
| 0       | 1       | 1       |
| 1       | 0       | 1       |
| 1       | 1       | 1       |

By adjusting weights and bias, the perceptron learns the correct function.

## **3. Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN)**  
A **Feed-Forward Neural Network (FNN)** is the most basic form of artificial neural network where data flows **only in one direction**, from the input layer to the output layer, without loops or cycles.  

### **Structure of a Feed-Forward Neural Network:**  
1. **Input Layer:** Receives raw input features, such as images, stock prices, or customer data.  
2. **Hidden Layers:** Each neuron applies a weighted sum and an activation function (such as **ReLU** or **Sigmoid**) to introduce non-linearity.  
3. **Output Layer:** Generates predictions, such as class labels in classification tasks or numerical values in regression tasks.  

### **Example:**  
A Feed-Forward Neural Network can be trained to predict **house prices** based on input features like:  
- **Square footage**  
- **Number of bedrooms**  
- **Location**  

The network learns the relationship between these features and house prices by adjusting the weights through training.

## **4. Backpropagation and Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**  
To train a neural network, we need a method to adjust the weights so that the predictions become more accurate. This is achieved using **backpropagation** and **gradient descent**.

### **Backpropagation Algorithm:**  
1. **Forward Pass:** Compute the predicted output using the current weights.  
2. **Calculate Loss:** Compare the predicted output with the actual value using a loss function (e.g., **Mean Squared Error for regression**, **Cross-Entropy for classification**).  
3. **Backward Pass:** Compute the gradients of the loss function with respect to each weight using the **chain rule of differentiation**.  
4. **Update Weights:** Adjust the weights using **gradient descent**, reducing the error in future predictions.  

### **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD):**  
- Instead of updating weights after processing the entire dataset, **SGD updates weights after processing a small batch of data**, making training **faster** and **more efficient** for large datasets.

- [Gradient Descent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHZwWFHWa-w)

## **5. Regularization and Dropout**  
Neural networks with many parameters tend to **overfit**, meaning they perform well on training data but fail to generalize to new data. Regularization techniques help improve generalization by reducing overfitting.

### **Types of Regularization:**
1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**  
   - Adds a penalty proportional to the absolute values of the weights.  
   - Shrinks less important weights to zero, effectively performing feature selection.  

2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**  
   - Adds a penalty proportional to the square of the weights.  
   - Prevents large weights, leading to a smoother model that generalizes better.  

3. **Dropout:**  
   - A technique where **random neurons are temporarily removed** during training.  
   - This prevents the network from relying too much on specific neurons and helps it learn more robust patterns.  

### **Example:**  
When training a neural network on the **MNIST dataset (handwritten digits recognition)**:  
- Without dropout: The model memorizes the training data but performs poorly on test data.  
- With dropout: The model learns general features of handwritten digits, improving test accuracy.

Neural networks are widely used in **investment management** for tasks such as: 

1. **Stock Price Prediction**
2. **Portfolio Optimization**
3. **Fraud Detection in Finance**

Each section will provide detailed explanations, examples, and an analysis of where and how each method is used, along with its strengths and weaknesses.

## 1. Stock Price Prediction

Stock price prediction is one of the most common applications of neural networks in finance. The task involves predicting the future price of a stock based on historical market data.

### **Subtopics:**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Preparing the historical stock data for use in training a neural network.
  - **Where to use**: Data preprocessing is essential when working with time-series data like stock prices.
  - **Why it's used**: Stock data often contains missing values, outliers, and varying scales, so it's important to clean and normalize the data.
  - **Example**: Using `MinMaxScaler` to scale stock prices to a range [0, 1] to make training more efficient.
  
- **Model Choice**: Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.
  - **FNN**: Simple neural network architecture where each layer is fully connected to the previous one. Suitable for predicting stock prices when historical data is not strongly dependent on time.
  - **LSTM**: Specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is designed to handle time-series data and learn long-term dependencies.
  - **When to use**: Use LSTM when the price movements have a strong time-dependent structure, such as stock prices or financial indicators.
  
- **Training and Testing**: Splitting data into training and test sets to avoid overfitting and evaluate model performance.
  - **Why it's needed**: Testing on unseen data helps assess the real-world performance of a model.

### **Example Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import LSTM
import yfinance as yf

# Load stock data using Yahoo Finance API
stock_symbol = 'AAPL'  # Example: Apple stock
data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start="2010-01-01", end="2023-01-01")

# Select 'Close' price for prediction
close_prices = data['Close'].values.reshape(-1, 1)

# Normalize data
scaler = MinMaxScaler(feature_range=(0, 1))
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(close_prices)

# Create the dataset for training
def create_dataset(data, time_step=60):
    X, y = [], []
    for i in range(time_step, len(data)):
        X.append(data[i-time_step:i, 0])  # Use last 'time_step' prices to predict the next one
        y.append(data[i, 0])  # The actual next price
    return np.array(X), np.array(y)

X, y = create_dataset(scaled_data)
X = X.reshape(X.shape[0], X.shape[1], 1)  # Reshaping for LSTM input

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Build the LSTM Model
model = Sequential()
model.add(LSTM(units=50, return_sequences=True, input_shape=(X_train.shape[1], 1)))
model.add(LSTM(units=50))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Output layer for predicting next price

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Predict the stock prices
predicted_stock_price = model.predict(X_test)
predicted_stock_price = scaler.inverse_transform(predicted_stock_price)

# Visualizing the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(data['Close'].index[-len(y_test):], scaler.inverse_transform(y_test.reshape(-1, 1)), color='blue', label='Actual Stock Price')
plt.plot(data['Close'].index[-len(y_test):], predicted_stock_price, color='red', label='Predicted Stock Price')
plt.title(f'{stock_symbol} Stock Price Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## 2. Portfolio Optimization

Portfolio optimization aims to allocate capital across different assets in a way that maximizes return while minimizing risk. Neural networks can help predict returns and optimize asset allocations.

### **Subtopics:**
- **Data and Features**: Identifying financial assets and calculating their returns.
  - **Where to use**: Historical data of asset prices is used to calculate daily returns and volatility.
  - **Why it's needed**: The optimization model requires historical performance data of the assets to predict future performance and allocate capital efficiently.
  
- **Neural Network Model**: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) or a similar architecture can be used to predict returns.
  - **When to use**: If the returns of assets depend on multiple factors, a neural network can handle non-linearity and correlations.
  - **Pros and Cons**: Neural networks can capture complex patterns but require large amounts of data to avoid overfitting.

### **Example Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
import yfinance as yf
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Define the stocks in the portfolio
stocks = ['AAPL', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'MSFT']
data = yf.download(stocks, start="2010-01-01", end="2023-01-01")['Adj Close']

# Calculate daily returns
returns = data.pct_change().dropna()

# Scale the returns
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_returns = scaler.fit_transform(returns)

# Define input and output for the neural network
X = scaled_returns
y = returns.mean(axis=1)  # Predict average return of the portfolio

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=False)

# Build the neural network model for portfolio optimization
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]))
model.add(Dense(units=32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1))  # Single output: predicted average return

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=32)

# Predict portfolio returns
predicted_returns = model.predict(X_test)

# Visualizing the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
plt.plot(y_test, label='True Portfolio Return', color='blue')
plt.plot(predicted_returns, label='Predicted Portfolio Return', color='red')
plt.title('Portfolio Return Prediction')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Return')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

## 3. Fraud Detection in Finance

Fraud detection is crucial for ensuring the integrity of financial systems. Neural networks can be used to identify patterns in transaction data that may indicate fraudulent activity.

### **Subtopics:**
- **Data and Features**: Preparing a dataset that includes transaction features such as amount, type, and time.
  - **Where to use**: The dataset typically contains both fraudulent and non-fraudulent transactions, which can be used for binary classification.
  - **Why it's needed**: Fraudulent patterns are often rare and require robust models that can generalize well on unseen data.
  
- **Model Choice**: Feed-Forward Neural Networks or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) can be used.
  - **When to use**: CNNs are used if spatial patterns (e.g., in images or structured grids) are important, but typically, FNNs work for structured data like transaction records.
  - **Pros and Cons**: Neural networks are effective at learning non-linear patterns, but they require a large amount of labeled data for training.

### **Example Code:**
```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from keras.models import Sequential
from keras.layers import Dense
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load the credit card fraud detection dataset (or use a similar dataset)
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HarvardEcon/machine_learning_public/main/credit_card_fraud.csv"
data = pd.read_csv(url)

# Prepare the dataset
X = data.drop('Class', axis=1)  # Drop the 'Class' column (fraud/non-fraud labels)
y = data['Class']  # Target labels (0: Non-fraud, 1: Fraud)

# Scale the features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split the dataset into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, shuffle=True)

# Build the neural network model
model = Sequential()
model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=X_train.shape[1]))
model.add(Dense(units=32, activation='relu'))
model.add(Dense(units=1, activation='sigmoid'))  # Sigmoid for binary classification

model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=20, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(X_test, y_test)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')

# Predict fraud probability
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
predictions = (predictions > 0.5)  # Convert probabilities to binary labels (0 or 1)
```
