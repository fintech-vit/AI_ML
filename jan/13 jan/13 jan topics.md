## Data Preprocessing
- Preparing raw data for ML models to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Steps**:
  - **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers.
  - **Data Transformation**: Normalize, scale, and encode features.
  - **Data Splitting**: Divide data into training, validation, and testing sets.

## ML Life Cycle
A structured process to develop and maintain ML models:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare data.
2. **Model Training**: Train the model on the prepared dataset.
3. **Model Selection**: Choose the best-performing model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Test the model on unseen data.
5. **Model Deployment**: Integrate the model into real-world applications.
6. **Model Maintenance**: Update the model as needed.
7. **Model Monitoring**: Track model performance and detect issues.

## Dataset for ML
- **Dataset**: Collection of data for training and evaluation.
- **Components**: 
  - **Features**: Input variables (e.g., height, weight).
  - **Labels**: Output variables (e.g., spam or not spam).
- **Types**:
  - Structured (e.g., tabular data).
  - Unstructured (e.g., images, text).

---

## Training vs. Testing
- **Training**: The model learns patterns from data.
- **Testing**: Evaluates the modelâ€™s performance on unseen data.

---

## Positive and Negative Class
- **Positive Class**: The target of interest (e.g., "has disease").
- **Negative Class**: The non-target (e.g., "no disease").

---

## Cross-Validation
- Splits data into `k` folds for evaluation.
- Trains on `k-1` folds and tests on the remaining fold. Repeats to calculate the average performance.

---

## Generalization
- The ability of a model to perform well on new, unseen data.
- Influenced by:
  - Data quality.
  - Model complexity.
  - Sufficient training.

---

## Parameter Estimation
- Finding optimal model parameters using training data.
- Example: Weights in a linear regression model.

---

## Probabilistic Modelling & Inference
- **Probabilistic Modelling**: Uses probability to handle uncertainty in data.
- **Inference**: Draws conclusions from the model to make predictions.

# Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Problems & Perspectives
- **Problems**:
  - Text classification (e.g., spam detection).
  - Sentiment analysis (e.g., positive/negative reviews).
  - Machine translation (e.g., English to French).
- **Perspectives**: Connects human language with machine understanding.

---

## Evaluation of NLP Applications
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: Correct predictions / Total predictions.
  - **Precision**: Relevant positives / Total predicted positives.
  - **Recall**: Relevant positives / Total actual positives.
  - **F1 Score**: Balance between precision and recall.
- Measures performance and usability of NLP systems.
